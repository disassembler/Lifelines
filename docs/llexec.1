.SH DESCRIPTION

llexec is a slimmed down version of the \fIllines\fR 
lifelines genealogy program, used for executing reports
from scripts.
.PP
llexec has simplified and stubbed out input/output in
place of llines curses interface, and expects to be invoked
with a report on the commandline (via the \fI-x\fR option).

.SH FILES
llexec looks for a configuration file for various settings, in
exactly the same manner as \fIllines\fR. See the lifelines userguide
for details.
.SH DOCUMENTATION
The LifeLines documentation should be installed as part of the installation,
and may also be viewed at the project site:
http://lifelines.sourceforge.net.
Look for ll-userguide and ll-reportmanual (with appropriate extensions for
text, html and pdf formats).
The normal installation process includes a large number of sample report
programs that you can customize to suit your needs.  In the directory
containing these reports you should find a file named index.html which gives a
very brief summary of each report.
