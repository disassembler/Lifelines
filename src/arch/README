LifeLines architecture compatibility library
============================================

This library contains replacement functions for standard functions
(POSIX, ANSI C, BSD, etc), to be used on platforms missing these
functions.

When using these functions, include <arch.h>.

Currently, the following functions are implemented:

int sleep(int)

  POSIX, implemented for Win32.

int alphasort(const struct dirent **, const struct dirent **);
int scandir(const char *, struct dirent ***, int (*)(const struct dirent *),
            int (*)(const struct dirent **, const struct dirent **));

  BSD, implemented for Unix and Win32.

int getopt(int argc, char **argv, char *optstring)

  POSIX, implemented for Win32.
